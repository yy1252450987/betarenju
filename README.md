This project is based on the junxiaosong
(https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku)

I used a likely-AlpahGoZero neural network structure and trained for 558 epoch. 

later I will check the MCTS procedure to have detailed insight into AlphaGoZero

Requiresities:

These packages vesions are validated
* numpy == 1.14.0
* keras == 2.2.4
* tensorflow == 1.13.1
* pygame == 1.9.4

Usage:

You can single-click to start, Here you are the second-palyer, the AI will lazi first, you can single-click to lazi until AI has done.
